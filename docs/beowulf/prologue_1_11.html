    <p>Scyld Scefing often deprived enemy armies, many nations, of
    mead benches.
    <p>He terrified nobles after he at first came to be destitute
    found.
    <p>He therefore experienced comfort, grew under heaven,
    prospered with glory, until every neighboring people beyond the
    sea had to listen to him, pay tribute.
    <p>That was a good king!
