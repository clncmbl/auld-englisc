    <pre>
     Hwæt! Wē Gār-Dena      in geār-dagum
     þēod-cyninga      þrym gefrūnon,
     hū þā æðelingas      ellen fremedon.
     Oft Scyld Scēfing      sceaðena þrēatum,
     monegum mǣgðum      meodo-setla oftēah.
     Egsode eorl,      syððan ǣrest wearð
     fēa-sceaft funden:      hē þæs frōfre gebād,
     wēox under wolcnum,      weorð-myndum ðāh,
     oð þæt him ǣghwylc      þāra ymb-sittendra
     ofer hron-rāde      hȳran scolde,
     gomban gyldan:      þæt wæs gōd cyning!

    <h2>Crude literal translation</h2>
    <p>Listen! We have heard of the glory of the kings of the
    Spear-Danes of olden days, how the princes showed courage.
    <p>Scyld Scefing often deprived enemy armies, many nations, of
    mead benches.
    <p>He terrified nobles after he at first came to be destitute
    found.
    <p>He therefore experienced comfort, grew under heaven,
    prospered with glory, until every neighboring people beyond the
    sea had to listen to him, pay tribute.
    <p>That was a good king!
