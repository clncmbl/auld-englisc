     Hwæt! wē Gār-Dena      in geār-dagum
     þēod-cyninga      þrym gefrūnon,
     hū þā æðelingas      ellen fremedon.
     Oft Scyld Scēfing      sceaðena þrēatum,
     monegum mǣgðum      meodo-setla oftēah.
     Egsode eorl,      syððan ǣrest wearð
     fēa-sceaft funden:      hē þæs frōfre gebād,
     wēox under wolcnum,      weorð-myndum ðāh,
     oð þæt him ǣghwylc      þāra ymb-sittendra
     ofer hron-rāde      hȳran scolde,
     gomban gyldan:      þæt wæs gōd cyning!



Seems easiest to copy and paste from here because it has diacritics.  The downside is that the dual language layout generally means copying line by line: https://heorot.dk/beowulf-rede-text.html.  This one might be better to use: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9701/9701-0.txt
